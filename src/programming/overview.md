# Programming Overview

The Programming chapter covers the basic concepts of programming in Java, 
including variables, classes, functions, and control structures.

It is not completely comprehensive, 
but it should provide a good foundation needed to program a robot for the FIRST Tech Challenge.

## Java Programming Language

Java is a popular programming language that is used for a wide range of applications,
including web development, mobile apps, and of course robotics.

## The Entry Point

The "entry point" in programming is where the execution of a program begins.
The Java entry point is the `main` method, which can be part of any class.
You need to have a `main` method in your program to run any code.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

The w3schools tutorials are a good starting point for learning Java,
including syntax, variables, operators, loops, and more.
They will be much more comprehensive than this guide,
so please refer to them if you need more information.

# Programming Overview

The primary language used for programming in FTC is Java, a very popular language
used in many industries from web browsers to video games (like Minecraft!). 
Another popular programming language used for FTC is Kotlin,
which has a lot of modern features that Java does not have.
Kotlin is also my preferred language for FTC.

The Programming chapter covers the basic concepts of programming in Java, 
including variables, classes, functions, and control structures.
It is not completely comprehensive, 
but it should provide a good foundation needed to program a robot for the FIRST Tech Challenge.

This guide will not teach basic Kotlin, but if you understand Java
it should be relatively intuitive to understand.
You can also use the Kotlin Language website linked on the [](Landing.topic) page,
which I personally think is a very good guide.
Some higher-level concepts *are* easier to use in Kotlin,
so this guide will use Kotlin.

## Java Programming Language

Java is a popular programming language that is used for a wide range of applications,
including web development, mobile apps, and of course robotics.

## The Entry Point

The "entry point" in programming is where the execution of a program begins.
The Java entry point is the `main` method, which can be part of any class.
You need to have a `main` method in your program to run any code.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Useful Resources

- [Java Programming Language](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
- [Java Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)

The w3schools tutorials are a good starting point for learning Java,
including syntax, variables, operators, loops, and more.
They will be much more comprehensive than this guide,
so please refer to them if you need more information.
